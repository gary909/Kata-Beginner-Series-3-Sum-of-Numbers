    <p>
        Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between <br>
        and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.<br>
        <br>
        Note: a and b are not ordered!<br>
        <br>
        Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)<br>
        <br>
        (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)<br>
        (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)<br>
        (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)<br>
        (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)<br>
        (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)<br>
        (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)<br>
